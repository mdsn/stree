stree
=====

Syntax tree drawing app for linguists. Renders in SVG using RaphaelJS, so technically you should be able to get a tree in whatever size you need it.

Most of the code is adapted/taken from [mshang's syntree](https://github.com/mshang/syntree) project to make it render in SVG, so pay him a visit and say thanks if you like.

Currently implemented features are:
* Movement lines
* Features
* Element strikeout

Nodes can be selected by clicking on them, and then edited. Deselect a node by clicking on it. Child nodes can be added, deleted and swapped to the left or right with their siblings.
